# Example change description

1. For the normal model conversion using the **Python API**, you can refer to the conversion process of other sample codes.
2. In addition, RKNN-Toolkit also supports model conversion with **less coding** and **more convenient verification functions** by writing yaml configuration files. For more details, please refer to the [rknn_model_zoo](https://github.com/airockchip/rknn_model_zoo "rknn model zoo") project to learn how to write your own model configuration file, using a unified model conversion script to complete the RKNN model **conversion and evaluation** task.
